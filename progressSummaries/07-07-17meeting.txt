## Meeting Fr, 07.07.17

1. Set up
- installed and set up Tensorflow on our own pcs as well as on our chair accounts

2. Data
- downloaded data
- implemented data pre-processing
- implemented reading data into Tensorflow

3. Network
- implemented the network structure definded in the paper
- set up loss function and optimizer 
- tried running it on the chairs pcs on a GPU, but got an error 

4. Optical Flow
- researched on good optical flow frameworks
- chosen: opencv for python 
- rather complicated to get opencv working in virtualenv: needed to install 'normal' on system, then create a symlink in the .evn to this globally installed version of opencv (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19155603/can-opencv-be-installed-in-python-virtualenv-on-mac-mountain-lion)
- started writing script to generate optical flow for driving dataset
