## Meeting Fr, 14.07.17

1.Image Conversion
- converted RGB images into YUV images
- use tf.uint8 to convert YUV to integer values (python uint8 cast does not work correctly)
- saved exemplary images to files using the python image library for plausability check

2.Network changes
- added random shuffle to batch selection
- changed batch size to prevent memory errors
- added kernel regularizer for weight decay
- added exponential learning rate decay

3.Network evaluation
- saved checkpoint data into .ckpt files
- saved loss and learning rate into event file for analysis with tensorboard
